<h4>Custom CSS Classes</h4>
<p>The widget output has custom CSS classes for most of the individual elements displayed.  The only exception is for the postal address, where all elements are treated as a block.  On the <a href="/wp-admin/admin.php?page=hcard-settings">settings page</a> you can use these classes to customize the look of the widgets to suit your needs.  You can find a complete list of the CSS classes used in the widgets <a href="http://lautman.ca/customizing-hcard-widget-css-classes/"target="_blank">here.</a>
